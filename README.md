# ArtBookProject

Thanks to Atil Samancioglu's training course, I created a ArtBookProject. In this project, users can add-delete artworks as they wish 
and keep a library in tableview. 

In this project I have learned,

- how to work with CoreData

- how to use do-try-catch structure

- notion of fetch concept
